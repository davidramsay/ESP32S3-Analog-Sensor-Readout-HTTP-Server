# ESP32S3-Analog-Sensor-Readout-HTTP-Server
This Repository contains the code to run a simple HTTP server which returns a JSON of the analog readout of pin A1 on an ESP32S3. You will need to use the serial monitor line input to provide the WiFi credentials, so power via the pins or a USB data/power splitter will be required. A version that makes use of NVS should be forthcoming shortly.
